I decided to switch my career to Software and technology in 2021. After learning the basics of programming, I found testing and QA more suitable for my character and skill set. 

I have learned HTML/CSS and Javascript Fundamentals, React at first, and then QA manual, automation, and management courses at Udemy. As practice after courses, before my first job I built my mini projects (which are still on GitHub). I'm currently improving my knowledge of software testing, and practice it daily, either at my work or theoretically. 

I work as a QA/QC/Tester since January 2022.
I'm looking to collaborate on QA freelance/remote jobs), using the above-mentioned knowledge and experience.
