- 👋 Hi, I’m @Berolius (George Beradze)
- 👀 I’m interested in Software and technology testing in general and specialize more on the web (frontend and backend QA/QC/testing). I work as a QA/QC/Testing engineer for BNB Group since 2021. I have tested and still maintain: binebi.ge fix.ge ex.ge manqanebi.ge
- 🌱 I have passed HTML/CSS and Javascript Fundamentals courses at Udemy, have built my mini projects (I have uploaded them here), and still love coding here and there, as well as challenges at codewars.com  I’m currently improving my knowledge at software testing,  and practice it daily, at my work.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on testing (preferable freelance/remote job), using the above-mentioned knowledge and experience.
